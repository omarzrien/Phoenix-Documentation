Do I need to install any of this?
=================================
Yes, if any of the following:

- You need library support for Talon SRX, Victor SPX, CANifier, Pigeon IMU
- You need to field upgrade Talon SRX, Victor SPX, CANifier, Pigeon IMU, PDP, or PCM
- You want to user Phoenix Tuner for CAN diagnostics (highly recommended)

.. note:: PCM and PDP objects are already supported in the base FRC installation. However, Phoenix Tuner is required for setting the device ID, field-upgrade, and self-test.
