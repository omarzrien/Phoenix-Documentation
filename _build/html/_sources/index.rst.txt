===================================
Sphinx is a powerful documentation generator that
has many great features for writing technical documentation including:

* Generate web pages, printable PDFs, documents for e-readers (ePub),
  and more all from the same sources
* You can use reStructuredText or :ref:`Markdown <intro/getting-started-with-sphinx:Using Markdown with Sphinx>`
  to write documentation
* An extensive system of cross-referencing code and documentation
* Syntax highlighted code samples
* A vibrant ecosystem of first and third-party extensions_
